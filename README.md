# MEDICAL INSURANCE ANALYSIS

# Overview
The Medical Insurance Project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals' medical insurance charges. This project explores various factors that contribute to medical insurance costs, such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into the key determinants of medical insurance charges and develop predictive models to estimate future insurance costs for individuals.
